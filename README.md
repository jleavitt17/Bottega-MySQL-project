>Build a SQL database for a university that manages students, courses, professors, and grades.

--Build a database with the following tables: Students, Courses, Professors, Grades
--Foreign key relationships between the tables
--Create a script that populates all of the database tables with sample data
--SQL query scripts for:
--The average grade that is given by each professor
--The top grades for each student
--Group students by the courses that they are enrolled in
--Create a summary report of courses and their average grades, sorted by the most challenging --course (course with the lowest average grade) to the easiest course
--Finding which student and professor have the most courses in common

<The Example DataBase for Students and Grades was created by generating over 2000 commands using javascript random() and String Interpolation >

SQL example query was generated using javascript
